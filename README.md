# EMPLOYMENT
## January 2021 to Present (Full Stack Developer - NovaFori)
- Designed and developed features for Christie's to enhance the Christies online only customer experience when customers place bids on the auction pages.
- Implemented an enhanced geo-restriction software solution for clients accessing art sales on the Christies auction page. For the geo-restriction solution, I researched and implemented data caching techniques to help improve performance of the solution. My implementation interfaced with a third-party system and calculated a users georestriction level whilst ensuring system performance was optimal.
- Contributed to continuous improvement by reviewing existing code, conducting traditional development works i.e., spikes, and proof of concept exercises which enhance my critical thinking skills and improve the works and systems they are involved with in the future.
- Debug software bugs and analyze error exception details to understand the root cause(s) of a software bug. I use my theoretical knowledge and practical programming skills to resolve bugs.
- Manage software releases, including overseeing automated, semi-automated, and manual steps to ensure code quality and the software release is successful.
- Worked on a data analytics project in collaboration with the NovaFori Data Analytics teams which delivers useful insights, automates reporting, enables feature tracking, and informs the development of analytics products.
- Focus on improving system performance, efficiency, and design through CLEAN programming methodologies, SOLID principles, and other proven design techniques.
- Practiced test-driven development (TDD), writing unit tests before implementing business logic, ensuring code meets customer requirements, remains reliable, maintainable, and scalable.
- Worked in an Agile framework and participated in essential scrum processes.

## November 2020 to January 2021 (Testing & Commissioning Site Supervisor - Crossrail)
- Managed a team of multidisciplinary engineers at numerous Crossrail sites for testing and commissioning works on the Crossrail data network, SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition), and Radio systems.
- Conducted site briefings and assessed engineers' competencies and equipment readiness.
- Created daily site reports which highlighted engineers, site works completed, health and safety incidents, and other relevant information for higher management.
- Mentored new employees to the testing and commissioning team, teaching them various aspects of the role, including testing procedures, safety protocols, documentation, reporting unsafe conditions, and reporting system faults.
- Conducted thorough briefings for site engineers to explain the day's work plans, assigned areas of responsibility, and expected outcomes.
- Responsible for effective communication with internal and external members of the Siemens project team.
- Assessed completed works, providing feedback to engineers, and identifying opportunities to improve individual and team performance.
- Communicated with higher management to confirm project objectives, address queries, and report safety incidents.
- Mentored employees, enhancing their confidence and competency as testing and commissioning site engineers through hands-on guidance and communication of technical and safety-related information.

## August 2018 to November 2020 (Testing and Commissioning/ Software Engineer - Crossrail)
- Developed a utility tool using my Microsoft ASP.NET skills and knowledge of network routing and switching. The tool dynamically assessed device reachability and performed automated SSH connections with core Cisco devices. With the utility tool, engineers can obtain real-time updates and historical logs for network devices, enabling swift issue identification and resolution.
- Responsible for resolving issues with the RCM (RailCom Manager) system and restoring its normal operations.
- Designed and delivered a unique data analytics system for IP-enabled railway assets, providing valuable insights for engineering teams. This data analytics system interfaced with various railway assets to generate useful dataset and performed data analysis asynchronously, generating insights from the collated dataset.
- Ensured the reliability, availability, and security of the Crossrail Cisco Data Network by continuously monitoring availability, latency, and health of critical assets. Ensuring all network issues are detected early and resolved.
- Resolved 90% of client issues on the latest product release through fault analysis, problem solving, implementation and testing.
- Gained key knowledge and experiences in Cisco Network Systems.

## August 2016 to August 2018 (Software Engineer/ Data Analytics Engineer)
- Acted as the project orchestrator on a project to design and deliver a bespoke Siemens SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) system for Network Rail's training facility.
- Conducted research on hardware and software technologies to meet client requirements.
- Participated in a digitization project which focused on solving problems with the UK railway systems. For the project, I organized weekly team meetings, chaired them, and conducted brainstorming sessions to generate multiple solutions to transportation problems.
- Achieved the lean practitioner certification by completing the Lean Competency System (LCS) lean practitioner application process.
- Conducted a lean improvement project at Siemens to minimize waste in the RTU (Remote Terminal Unit) production process.
- Developed a new production layout to reduce non-productive time by at least 60%, creating individual workspaces for technicians and streamlining production.
- Demonstrated a strong understanding of safety in roles at
- Facilitated in the designed, development of the Nokia SAM communication service for the Riyadh Metro project. Created several features that enhanced the user experience and ultimately the performance of the system.
- Led a small team of engineers to the successful design, implementation, testing and commissioning of a unique RTU product which is currently operating at NTAR (National Training Academy for Rail).
- Initiated and implemented the data analytics of the Strukton points dataset which brought about the increase in performance of our SCADA capability on railway points.
- Worked in an agile development environment, used scrum, and was involved in the continuous integration and delivery, deploying to production weekly.
- Used the TDD techniques and worked to the S.O.L.I.D. principles during the software design and development processes.
- Gained key knowledge and experiences in object-oriented languages such as C#, C++, Java, and Pascal.

## September 2015 to May 2016 (R&D Engineer)
- Completed an industrial research project with Siemens RA CIS in my final year. This project looked at the feasibility of creating a mobile (Android/IOS) interface for their SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) system.

## July 2014 to August 2015 (Industrial Placement / Internship)
- Supported the engineering teams to deliver high quality technical and engineering solutions for large multi-disciplined projects for clients related to Control and Information systems, primarily in the rail sector.
